Prompt in Ask Mode: 
i am thinking of developing rest api in this project. what is the right project structure for it? the feature i want to have is for products. it is a simple CRUD app.


after the answer from AI, I picked up the following structure.
Identified Project Structure 
---
  src/main/java/com/hexaware/labs/
    controller/   // Handles HTTP requests (e.g., ProductController)
    service/      // Business logic (e.g., ProductService)
    repo/         // Data access (e.g., ProductRepository)
    model/        // Domain models/entities (e.g., Product)



Prompt in Agent Mode: 
create products rest api with contoller, service, repo and model layers for h2 db.
    it should handle CRUD operations.
    make sure you follow the right project structure like the following
    src/main/java/com/hexaware/labs/
        controller/   // Handles HTTP requests (e.g., ProductController)
        service/      // Business logic (e.g., ProductService)
        repo/         // Data access (e.g., ProductRepository)
        model/        // Domain models/entities (e.g., Product)

    ensure you follow standard recommended conventions, best practices.
